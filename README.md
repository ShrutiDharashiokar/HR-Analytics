# Business Problem
HR teams often lack a consolidated view of workforce data, making it difficult to track salary distribution, employee demographics, leave patterns, and role-wise headcount. This limits their ability to make informed decisions about workforce planning, compensation strategy, and employee management. The dashboard provides a centralized, interactive solution to monitor these key HR metrics effectively.
